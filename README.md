API examples are found [here](https://certdev0.incommontest.org/incommon/).

Templates
---------
The tool starts which a base configuration profile template, adds the user's certificate as another payload, and replaces any tokens in the template with real values. The current tokens are:

	$username$
	$pkcs12UUID$
 
Any occurence of these token in the template will be replaced with the user's actual username and the payload UUID of the user's actual certificate.

Profiles can be generated by Apple's [Profile Manager](http://www.apple.com/support/osxserver/profilemanager/) or by hand. See [Configuration Profile Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html) for more information about possible payload types, keys, and values.
